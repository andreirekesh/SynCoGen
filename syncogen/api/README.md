`BBRxnGraph` and `Coordinates`, wrapping building block one-hot tensors and atomic coordinates, are the primary data objects propagated throughout SynCoGen.

SynCoGen wraps synthesizable molecules and masks alike into `BBRxnGraphs`. These objects contain (often, batches of) building block and reaction vocabulary indices and one-hot representations. 

`BBRxnGraph`s can be instantiated from one-hot tensors or lists of indices as generated by `/syncogen/vocabulary/scripts/`. These objects track both the building block nodes and reaction edge matrix of a synthesis graph. 

`Coordinates` objects are wrappers on atomic coordinate tensors. These can be initialized either from a known coordinate tensor and an optional valid atom mask or from an isotropic Gaussian. For the pharmacophore conditioning case, `Coordinates` objects can be equipped with pharmacophore coordinates and bond information. This class handles augmentations such as random rotations, centering, and alignment; attached pharmacophore coordinates are transformed along with the coordinate tensor.
